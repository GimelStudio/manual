# Official Gimel Studio Manual

This is the repository for the official manual for [Gimel Studio](https://gimelstudio.github.io), the node-based 2D image graphics editor, focused on simplicity, speed, elegance and usability.

Read the latest version of the manual at [https://gimelstudio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://gimelstudio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


## Contributing

All contributions are welcome! We can use help updating and adding to the current sections for the v0.6.x series. Fixing typos is always appreciated. ;)

The manual is written in ReStructuredText and uses Sphinx to build HTML and PDF versions, etc.


## Building from source

The Gimel Studio docs use the Sphinx package and a slighty customized readthedocs theme.

``pip install -r requirements.txt``
``make html``

You will find the HTML docs in the ``build`` folder.
