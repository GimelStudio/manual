Introduction
============

Gimel Studio can be used to edit photographs, post-process and/or composite images, generate texture maps for 3D or just for experimenting with your own image processing via scripting a custom node in Python.

Gimel Studio aims to be simple enough for non-technical people to use, yet provide a powerful and streamlined experience for professional editing.

It currently has low-hardware requirements, supports many different file types and runs on Windows, Linux and MacOs systems.


Feature Highlights
==================

.. note::
    This applies to version v0.5.3 as the 0.6.x series is not yet ready for use and does not have these features yet.

Gimel Studio is currently in *beta status and heavy development* with more features and fixes to come!

At the moment, Gimel Studio already features:

* **Fully non-destructive editing**, giving you the freedom to edit node properties and change the order of nodes at any time in a non-destructive workflow.
* **Comprehensive image previews**, providing comprehensive image previews for each step of the process, allowing you to quickly see the effects of each node.
* **Integratation with Blender 3D** via the free Blender Gimel Studio bridge addon for quicker post-render compositing.
* **Python API for scripting nodes** built-in for scripting custom nodes with access to libraries like Scipy, Numpy and OpenCV.
* **20+ built-in nodes** for various editing tasks, from post-processing a photo to generating texture maps for use in 3D software from an image.

Gimel Studio also has rearrangable and resizable panels for customizing the main UI, a fully-featured Node Graph (with node deletion, duplication, selection) and more.
