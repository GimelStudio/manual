0.6.0 alpha 1
=============

Gimel Studio v0.6.0 alpha 1 beta is in progress. :)


Start of the next generation
----------------------------

This is the start of the v0.6.x series, which is and has been, in development as a total re-write and re-thinking of Gimel Studio.


Move to Github Organization
---------------------------

All the related Gimel Studio repositories were moved from the personal account at https://github.com/Correct-Syntax to the Gimel Studio Github organization at https://github.com/GimelStudio in an effort to make this more of a community-based project than before.


New Github Repository
---------------------

The previous development repository at https://github.com/GimelStudio/Gimel-Studio was  archived and the new repository at https://github.com/GimelStudio/GimelStudio is the focus of all new development of Gimel Studio.


New Landing Page
----------------

A new landing page at https://gimelstudio.github.io/ was setup, eventually to become the offical Gimel Studio website.
