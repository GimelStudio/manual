Gimel Studio Manual
===================

Welcome to the manual for Gimel Studio, the free & open-source, non-destructive (node-based) 2D image graphics editor, focused on simplicity, speed, elegance and usability.

.. note::

    Gimel Studio is currently in early stages of development and is not stable. Not all features are implemented and things may be broken at any time.


Version Clarification
=====================

To be clear, there are currently **two major versions** of Gimel Studio:

- **Version 0.5.3 beta and previous**
- **The version 0.6.x series and onward**

**Version 0.5.3 beta** and previous versions were developed at: https://github.com/GimelStudio/Gimel-Studio.

*Releases and source code for 0.5.3 beta and previous versions are still available at:* https://github.com/GimelStudio/Gimel-Studio/releases.

**The 0.6.x series** is a major re-write and re-thinking of the application and is currently in development at: https://github.com/GimelStudio/GimelStudio

.. warning::
   This documentation mainly talks about version v0.5.3 as **new documentation needs to be written for the upcoming 0.6.x series**. (If you would like to help in the documentation effort, please let us know).
