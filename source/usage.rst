Gimel Studio Usage
==================

This part of the documentation shows basic usage of Gimel Studio.


Gimel Studio Panels
-------------------

Gimel Studio's UI is made up of rearrangable (dockable) and resizeable panels.


Image Viewport
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This panel is where the final result, the rendered "composite" image, will be shown. The image preview will be auto-updated each time a change is made to the Node tree in the Node Graph, if you have the *Auto Render* setting ticked in menu (Render > Auto Render).


Node Graph
^^^^^^^^^^

The Node Graph panel is where you add and connect nodes, etc. to create a node tree. Nodes are connected in the desired order to produce a rendered "composite" image with the effects and manipulations applied when connected to the final node in the node tree, the Output Node.


Node Properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Node Properties panel is where the properties of the node selected in the Node Graph are displayed, if any.
